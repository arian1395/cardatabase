# Dependency Injection

* CommandLineRunner interface will be used to add code to be executed just after all Spring objects have been created
* Value injection
* Create an object inside other object
  * Mary has two cars, we need to create two same Owner object for her
  * In case of unit test of object, we could not easily replace some fake dependent objects
