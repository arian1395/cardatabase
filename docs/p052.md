# Entities Relationship

## Make Owner as Entity
1. add @Entity / @Id / @GeneratedValue 
2. create OwnerRepository interface

## Two-way links

In Car.java
```java
	@ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
	@JoinColumn(name="owner")
	private Owner owner;
```

Fetch Types:
* lazy
* eager

In Owner.java
```java
	@OneToMany(cascade= CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy="owner")
	private List<Car> cars;
```
Cascade Types:
* ALL
* PERSIST
* MERGE
* REMOVE
* REFRESH
* DETACH

## add sequence generator 
* examine ids of two entities : CAR not found!
