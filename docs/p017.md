# @SpringBootApplication

It is a combination of multiple annotations:

## @SpringBootConfiguration

* The class can define _beans_ via its methods
* It is as same as @Configuration

## @EnableAutoConfiguration

* It configures the project based on dependencies. 
* You may disable any related autoconfiguring classes via _exclude_ array attribute

##  @ComponentScan

* It configures the base packages for scanning via _scanBasePackages_ String array attribute
* All sub packages of the SpringBootApplication will be automatically scanned
